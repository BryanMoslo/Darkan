# Darkan üê∂

Darkan is a Go application that sniffs into libreddit (for now) for a given keyword and returns the HTML content if the keyword is present.

## Tor Installation

Before using Darkan, you need to install Tor on your machine and add it to your $PATH. You can install Tor using Homebrew by running the following command:

```bash
$ brew install tor
$ export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin/tor:$PATH"
```

**Update:** Now you don't need to open it or establish a connection manually, however, you still need a Tor instance, it can be local (recommended) or remote.

## Running in development

### Setup
The first step you need to do is to create a development database and run the migrations by running:

```
$ go run ./cmd/db create
$ go run ./cmd/db migrate
```

### Running 
To run the app in development you can run the following command:

```
$ go run ./cmd/dev
```

Root path for the endpoints will be available at http://localhost:3000.
